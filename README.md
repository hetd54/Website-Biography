# Website Biography
A website using Vue.js containing information about me.

## Pages
I have used vue-router in order to route to the following pages:

#### Home
The home page contains my resume, skills, education information, and a short blurb about my interests.

#### Contact
A contact form which users may submit a message to me. The backend is not implemented, so the message stating "Your message has been sent!" is a lie.

#### Blender
A image gallery of blender models that I have created.

## Deployment
